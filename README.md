**Research Question: Is cancer funded in the US according to cancer prevalence or mortality rate, or is funded due to external forces (media, public awareness, etc.)?**

Data Sets:
* NIH Categorical Spending on different cancer types
* NPCR and SEER Incidence â€“ U.S. Cancer Statistics Public Use Databases
  * Needed to submit form to recieve data, but have used this data set before. It reports on a variety of U.S. cancer statistics including cancer type prevalence, mortality rate, etc.
